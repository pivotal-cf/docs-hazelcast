This topic describes how developers use Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise for Pivotal Platform.

After your Pivotal Platform operator installs the Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise for Pivotal Platform tile, it automatically registers itself to the Marketplace.

Follow these steps to create an instance of the Hazelcast service based on an available plan and bind it to your app. The plans available to you are determined by your Pivotal Platform operator. For more information about configuring plans, see [Installing and Configuring Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise for Pivotal Platform](installing.html).

## <a id="marketplace"></a> Checking Availability

1. To check availability of Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise for Pivotal Platform, run the following command:

    ```
    $ cf marketplace
    ```
    For example,

    <pre class="terminal">
$ cf marketplace
Getting services from marketplace in org system / space system as admin...
OK<br>
service         plans                            description
app-autoscaler 	bronze, gold                     Scales bound applications in response to load (beta)
hazelcast       t2.micro, t2.small, m3.medium    Hazelcast Service
    </pre>

## <a id="create-service"></a> Create and Bind a Service to Your App

1. Create a file named `hazelcast.json` using this [sample Hazelcast JSON file](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-code-samples/blob/master/hazelcast-integration/pcf-integration/hazelcast.json) as a template.

<p class="note"><strong> Note:</strong>
 Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise for Pivotal Platform v2.0.0
 and later require JSON config file that uses new structure. For more information about JSON config structure, see <a href="./json-config">JSON Config Structure</a> </p> section.

1. Replace `YOUR_LICENSE_KEY` with the active Hazelcast Enterprise License or a trial license. For more information, see [License](index.html#license).

1. To create a cluster, run the following command:

    ```
    $ cf create-service hazelcast PLAN SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME -c hazelcast.json
    ```
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
$ cf create-service hazelcast t2.micro micro-cluster -c hazelcast.json
Creating service instance micro-cluster in org system / space system as admin...
OK<br>
Create in progress. Use 'cf services' or 'cf service micro-cluster' to check operation status.
    </pre>

  You can create 2 nodes Hazelcast cluster only with one line command as well:
    ```
    $ cf cs hazelcast small hz -c '{"hazelcast": {"license-key": "PUT_LICENSE_HERE"}}'
    ````
1. To bind the service to your app, run the following commands:

    ```
    $ cf bind-service MY-APPLICATION SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME
    $ cf restage MY-APPLICATION
    ```
    For example,
    <pre class="terminal">
$ cf bind-service myapp micro-cluster
$ cf restage myapp
    </pre>

1. Start using the Hazelcast in-memory data grid (IMDG). Necessary parameters are passed to your application in `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable. See [this sample Hazelcast Spring Boot application](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-code-samples/tree/master/hazelcast-integration/pcf-integration) for further information.


### <a id='json-config'></a> JSON Config Structure
Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise 3.12 comes with `YAML 1.2` configuration [support](https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#configuring-declaratively-yaml), `YAML 1.2` has a `JSON`` support as well. It gives an opportunity to use native JSON configuration support at tile side accordingly.

The JSON structure consists of two section/JSONs, `hazelcast-pcf` section contains tile specific parameters, section `hazelcast` is derived from Hazelcast YAML file:
```
{
    "hazelcast-pcf": {
        "instanceCount": 2,
        "jvmOptions": "",
        "tlsArchiveUrl": "",
        "userCodeURl": "",
        "mancenterAppName": "mancenter",
        "mancenterLicense": "",
        "mancenterJvmOptions": ""
    },
    "hazelcast": {
        "license-key": "PUT_LICENSE_HERE",
        "management-center": {
          "enabled": true
        }
    }
}
```

A [hazelcast-fullconfig.yaml](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/test/resources/hazelcast-fullconfig-without-network.yaml) sample config is available to show syntax for advanced settings. You can copy the relevant parts to your own YAML config file and change the values according to your needs.

Then you can convert your `hazelcast.yaml` configuration file with one line command that utilizes [yq](https://mikefarah.github.io/yq/) and [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) tools:
```
yq r -j /path/to/hazelcast.yaml | xargs jq .
```
Or you can convert the yaml file via any yaml-json converter.

Lastly, copy the JSON output directly into `hazelcast` section at main service configuration JSON.


## <a id='wan-replication'></a> Configuring WAN Replication

For more information on configuring WAN replication in Pivotal Platform, see [the official documentation](https://hazelcast.com/products/wan-replication/).

### <a id='source-cluster'></a> Source Cluster

In this example, we will use the Eureka service registry for target cluster discovery. This was tested with Eureka server v1.4.12.

Edit the `hazelcast.json` file for the source cluster to include the following `wanReplicationConfigs` configuration:

```
{
  "hazelcast": {
    "wan-replication": {
      "my-wan-cluster": {
        "wan-publisher": {
          "class-name": "com.hazelcast.enterprise.wan.replication.WanBatchReplication",
          "group-name": "cluster-name",
          "queue-capacity": 1000,
          "queue-full-behavior": "DISCARD_AFTER_MUTATION",
          "properties": {
            "batch.max.delay.millis": 3000,
            "batch.size": 50,
            "group.password": "cluster-password",
            "maxEndpoints": 5
          },
          "aws": {
            "enabled": false
          },
          "eureka": {
            "enabled": true,
            "environment": "test",
            "name": "hazelcast-target",
            "namespace": "hazelcast",
            "self-registration": false,
            "serviceUrl.default": "http://<my-eureka>/eureka",
            "shouldUseDns": false,
            "use-classpath-eureka-client-props": false
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Change `group-name` and `group.password` to match your existing target cluster configuration, `serviceUrl.default` to match your Eureka service endpoint, and any other config values to your needs.

In this example we want to set up WAN replication for a map called `my-map`. This can be achieved by including the following `hazelcast` section in your `hazelcast.json`:

```
{
  "hazelcast": {
    "map": {
      "my-map": {
        "wan-replication-ref": {
          "my-wan-cluster": {
            "filters": [],
            "merge-policy": "com.hazelcast.map.merge.PassThroughMergePolicy",
            "republishing-enabled": false
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Change any value as needed.

#### <a id='management-center-support'></a> Management Center Support

To enable the WAN replication features in Management Center (e.g. manual sync), do not forget to include the following `properties` configuration:

```
{
	"hazelcast": {
    "properties": {
			"hazelcast.rest.enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

### <a id='target-cluster'></a> Target Cluster

This example uses Eureka service registry for cluster member discovery. This allows the other cluster (the source cluster) to find the addresses for this cluster by means of Eureka, as shown in the previous example.

Edit the `hazelcast.json` file for the target cluster to include the following `hazelcast` section:

```
{
	"hazelcast": {
		"network": {
      "multicast:" {
        "enabled:" false
      },
      "eureka": {
        "enabled": true,
        "environment": "test",
        "name": "hazelcast-target",
        "namespace": "hazelcast",
        "self-registration": true,
        "serviceUrl.default": "http://<my-eureka>/eureka",
        "shouldUseDns": false,
        "use-classpath-eureka-client-props": false
      }
		}
  }
}
```

Change `serviceUrl.default` to match your Eureka service endpoint, and any other config values to your needs.


## <a id='user-code-config'></a> Configuring User Code Deployment

This section explains how to configure user code deployment, i.e. how to deploy user code at service creation/start-up time.

### <a id='summary'></a> Summary of Functionality

You can specify additional jar(s) to be added to the server's classpath. A new optional JSON configuration key (`userCodeUrl`) has been defined and can be used to specify one or more URLs for the additional jar(s).

### <a id='tech-design'></a> Technical Design

The new JSON configuration key `userCodeUrl` can be instantiated either as a `string` or as `string[]`. For example, a single jar can be specified with the following syntax.

```
{
    "hazelcast-pcf": {
        "userCodeUrl": "<usercode-url>"
    }
}
```

To specify multiple jars, the following syntax can be used:

```
{
    "hazelcast-pcf": {
      "userCodeUrl": [
        "<usercode-url-1>", ..., "<usercode-url-n>"
      ]
    }
}
```

Every string specified in `userCodeUrl` must be a valid, reachable URL.

At server start-up time, the jar(s) will be downloaded and added to Hazelcast member's classpath.

During service update, all existing user code jars will be removed before re-downloading the jar(s) specified in `userCodeUrl`. The user is therefore expressly allowed to update, add, or delete user code jars with a `service-update` operation by changing the `userCodeUrl` property.


## <a id='config-tls'></a> Configuring Transport Layer Security

This section explains how to configure SSL/TLS for secure communication. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocol was introduced to establish an encrypted communication across your cluster with key stores and trust stores. SSL is now deprecated, so you will be using its successor TLS (Transport Layer Security).

### <a id='summary-2'></a> Summary of Functionality

Hazelcast allows you to encrypt socket level communication between Hazelcast members and between Hazelcast clients and members, for end to end encryption. For more information, see [the official Hazelcast TLS documentation](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#tlsssl).

### <a id='tech-design-2'></a> Technical Design

The new JSON configuration key `tlsArchiveUrl` is a `string` that must contain a valid, reachable URL for a `.tar.gz` (or `.tgz`) archive. The archive must contain exactly two files, the Hazelcast key store (file must be named `keystore`) and the Hazelcast trust store (file must be named `truststore`).

```
{
    "hazelcast-pcf": {
        "tlsArchiveUrl": "<archive-url>"
    }
}
```

### <a id='example-config'></a> Example Configuration

The following snippet contains the relevant parts of json configuration for enabling TLS. The `tlsArchiveUrl` points to an archive containing password-protected key and trust stores. Passwords for the stores are specified in the configuration itself, with `keyStorePassword` and `trustStorePassword`. Always specify `"protocol": "TLS"` and specify the correct `keyManagerAlgorithm` and `trustManagerAlgorithm` for your stores.

```
{
    "hazelcast-pcf": {
        "tlsArchiveUrl": "https://mydomain/myfiles/test.tgz"
    }
    "hazelcast": {
      "network": {
          "ssl": {
            "enabled": true,
            "factory-class-name": "com.hazelcast.nio.ssl.BasicSSLContextFactory",
            "properties": {
              "keyManagerAlgorithm": "SunX509",
              "keyStorePassword": 123456,
              "protocol": "TLS",
              "trustManagerAlgorithm": "SunX509",
              "trustStorePassword": 123456
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
}
```

### <a id='openssl'></a> Using OpenSSL

Hazelcast provides integration with OpenSSL, which can provide significant performance improvements. For more information, see [the official Hazelcast OpenSSL integration documentation](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#integrating-openssl).

The OpenSSL libraries and supporting artifacts are already included with Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise for Pivotal Platform. To enable the OpenSSL integration the configuration, you must include `"factoryClassName": "com.hazelcast.nio.ssl.OpenSSLEngineFactory"` in the `sslConfig`, as in the example below.

```
{
  "hazelcast": {
    "network": {
      "ssl": {
        "enabled": true,
        "factory-class-name": "com.hazelcast.nio.ssl.OpenSSLEngineFactory",
        "properties": {}
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## <a id='rolling'></a> Performing a Rolling Upgrade

Hazelcast clusters can be update with a Rolling Upgrade procedure.

### Minor vs Patch release upgrade

You can update IMDG version x.y.z to version x.y.z' where z' > z at any time.
This is called a patch release upgrade.

The protocol version of all members will stay the same and it is identified by x.y.

For instance, suppose you are upgrading from 3.11.3 to 3.11.4.
In this case the protocol version is not going to change and it is 3.11.

You can also update IMDG version to x.y.z to version x.y'.z' where y' = y + 1 (and no particular relation exists between z and z').
This is called a minor release upgrade.

In this case to conclude the Rolling Upgrade procedure, after all members are upgraded to version x.y'.z'
the protocol version needs to be upgraded to version x.y'.

For instance, suppose you are upgrading from 3.11.4 to 3.12.4.
In this case, at the conclusion of the rolling upgrade procedure,
the protocol version needs to be upgraded from 3.11 to 3.12.

Please note that version of the tiles are independent of the version of Hazelcast IMDG,
but they do follow semantic versioning.
Please check the IMDG versions for the old and the new tile in the documentation.

### Minor release upgrade: Configuration needed

In order to trigger the protocol version upgrade for a minor release upgrade,
the REST API feature must be enabled in the configuration for the cluster members.
It can be permanently enabled or just temporarily for the Rolling Upgrade procedure.
In any case, if you are doing a Minor release upgrade you have to enable the REST API
before starting the Rolling Upgrade procedure.

In order to enable the REST API, you must add the following property to your `json`
configuration:

```
{
	"hazelcast": {
    "properties": {
		  "hazelcast.rest.enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Starting the Rolling Upgrade procedure

After a successful tile update (e.g. via the Ops Manager), you can trigger a Rolling Update
for a particular service instance by executing:

```
$ cf update-service my-hazelcast-instance -c my-hazelcast-config.json
```

Of course, you must have enabled the REST API in your `json` configuration
in case of a minor version upgrade.

You can monitor the RU live with the like of

```
$ watch cf service my-hazelcast-instance
```

### Minor release upgrade: Upgrading the protocol version

Go to Management Center, log in. Go to Administration Panel, then Rolling Upgrade.
Enter cluster name and password and the new protocol version (e.g., "3.12").
Click Upgrade Protocol.

The Rolling Upgrade is now complete.

#### Disabling the REST API

At this point, if you wish to disable the REST API you can remove it from the configuration
and then trigger another rolling update of the configuration:

```
$ cf update-service my-hazelcast-instance -c my-hazelcast-config.json
```

The new configuration will be applied to all members.
