title: Using Hazelcast for PCF

This topic describes how developers use Hazelcast for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

After your PCF operator installs the Hazelcast for PCF tile, it automatically registers itself to the Marketplace. 

Follow these steps to create an instance of the Hazelcast service based on an available plan and bind it to your app. 
The plans available to you are determined by your PCF operator. 
For more information about configuring plans, see [Installing and Configuring Hazelcast for PCF](installing.html).

1. To check availability of Hazelcast for PCF, enter the following command:

    ```
    $ cf marketplace
    ```
    For example, 

    <pre class="terminal">
$ cf marketplace 
Getting services from marketplace in org system / space system as admin... 
OK<br>

    </pre>

1. Create a file named `hazelcast.json` using this [sample Hazelcast JSON file](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-code-samples/blob/master/hazelcast-integration/pcf-integration/hazelcast.json) as a template. 

1. Replace `YOUR_LICENSE_KEY` with the active Hazelcast Enterprise License or a trial license. For more information, see [License](index.html#license). 

1. To create a cluster, enter the following command:
  
    ```
    $ cf create-service hazelcast PLAN SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME -c hazelcast.json
    ```
    For example, 
    <pre class="terminal">
$ cf create-service hazelcast t2.micro micro-cluster -c hazelcast.json
Creating service instance micro-cluster in org system / space system as admin...
OK<br> 
Create in progress. Use 'cf services' or 'cf service micro-cluster' to check operation status. 
    </pre>

3. To bind the service to your app, enter the following commands:

    ```
    $ cf bind-service MY-APPLICATION SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME
    $ cf restage MY-APPLICATION
    ```
    For example,
    <pre class="terminal">
$ cf bind-service myapp micro-cluster
$ cf restage myapp
    </pre>

4. Start using the Hazelcast in-memory data grid (IMDG). Necessary parameters are passed to your application in
 `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable. See [this sample Hazelcast Spring Boot application](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-code-samples/tree/master/hazelcast-integration/pcf-integration)
 for further information.
