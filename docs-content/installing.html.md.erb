3. Click **First On-demand plan**. In the **Hazelcast on-demand plan** pane, do the following:
    1. Enter a **Plan name**.
    2. Enter a **Plan description**.
    For an example of how the plan name and description appear on the command line, see [Step 1](using.html#marketplace) in the _Using Hazelcast Platform Enterprise for VMware Tanzu_ topic.

4. Specify the number of **Hazelcast instances** for this plan. This property defines the number of Hazelcast instances to be created. It can be overridden for each service instance when creating a service instance by using `instanceCount` parameter. See [Step 2](using.html#create-service) in the _Using Hazelcast Platform Enterprise for VMware Tanzu_ topic for more information.

5. Select a **Hazelcast VM type**. Choose a suitable VM type according to your data size and processing power requirements.

6.  If you are planning on using features like [Hot Restart](https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.0/manual/html-single/#hot-restart-persistence) that require a persistent disk, select a **Hazelcast Disk type**. Otherwise, you can leave this option empty because Hazelcast, by default, does not require a persistent disk.

7. Select a **Management Center VM type**.

8. If you are planning on migrating Management Center between service instances and deployments that require a persistent disk, select a **Management Center VM type**. Otherwise, you can leave this option empty because Management Center, by default, does not require a persistent disk.

9.  Select the **Hazelcast availability zone(s)** in which to create VMs for this plan.

10. Click **Save**.

11. If you want to modify the additional Hazelcast Platform Enterprise for VMware Tanzu plans, repeat the step above to configure the second and third on-demand plans.

12. Click **Errands** and ensure that both **Register on-demand broker** and **Deregister on-demand broker** are selected. These are necessary to create and destroy Hazelcast service instances. You can disable **smoke-tests** errand to decrease installation time.
