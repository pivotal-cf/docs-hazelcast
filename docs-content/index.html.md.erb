This documentation describes how to install, configure, and use Hazelcast for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).
Hazelcast for PCF registers a service broker on PCF and exposes its service plans on the Marketplace.
Developers can provision Hazelcast clusters by creating instances of the service plans using the cf CLI.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

Hazelcast for PCF uses an on-demand services SDK, which is a part of [Pivotal Cloud Services SDK](https://network.pivotal.io/products/on-demand-services-sdk),
to fully utilize BOSH-2.0 features and let you provision instances more flexibly.

Features of Hazelcast for PCF include the following:

* Based on [Hazelcast Enterprise](https://hazelcast.com/), the leading in-memory data grid (IMDG)
* The ability to dynamically pass your Hazelcast configuration in JSON format while creating services
* An on-demand service broker that dynamically creates and scales Hazelcast clusters without pre-provisioning blocks of VMs
